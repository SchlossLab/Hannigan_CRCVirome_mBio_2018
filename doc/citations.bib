annote = {- Purpose is to bypass culturing to evaluate what phages infect which host.

- Understanding phage-host links is important for evolution and competition insights.

- Hi-C can be used to identify phages by their proximity to the bacterial genome.

- Nice paper becuase it goes through the most common approach for detecting phages.

- Problem is that their false positives are based on a lack of evidence, which is a faulty assumption.

- Would have been nice if they combined approaches.}
